Q11:Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each 
country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how
much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all 
customers who spent this amount
ANS:
#Explanation Of Question
#Humei is question mei 3 chezei nikalni hai 
1:Calculate the total amount spent by each customer in each country.
2:Determine the maximum amount spent by any customer within each country.
3:Identify and list all customers who spent this maximum amount in their respective countries.

#We have to make 2 CTE ,1 for total spending of customer on each country ,3 maximum spending of 
customer on each country
1CTE:That will give total spending by customer

2CTE:This will give maximum spending by customer in each country
SELECT
